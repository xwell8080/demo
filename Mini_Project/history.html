            <h2>Etymology</h2> 
            <p>Historical records regarding the origin of the name Batac are not available. Nevertheless, the people believe that Batac was already the name of the place even before the coming of the Spaniards. In some early accounts of the Spaniards, the name of the town was also written as Batag (Blair and Robertson, 1973).

                There are three theories through which the natives of the place explain how their town got its name. One is that Batac is indigenous to the place. The term Batac means an assistance given to another who is in need of help. Hence, the name must have been derived from the common trait of the people who are ever ready to extend a helping hand to anybody whether he is a native of Batac or not.
                
                Another theory is that, it must have been the Indonesians who settled in the place who had given the name Batac. These Indonesians migrated to the archipelago from Southeastern Asia about 5,000 years ago (Zaide, 1968).
                
                Third version traces the origin of the name Batac to a folktale which goes: Legend has it that many years ago, a certain spot in the town of Batac which was still a wilderness, there was a man digging for a root crop called camangeg. It is said that while he was digging, he accidentally fell into the deep, narrow hole. He struggled hard to get out but his efforts were all in vain. He cried for help but there was nobody around. He waited for hours and had given up hope of being saved when fortunately, two men from neighboring town of Paoay happened to pass by. They heard the man shouting and traced it to where he was trapped. Upon seeing him, they heard the man say “Bataquennac! Bataquennac!” The two men did not understand until the man explained that he was saying, “Help me up! Help me up!” Upon understanding what he meant, the two men hauled him out of the hole. When the two men reached their hometown, they told their story to their friends. Since then, the town has been called “Batac,” which is derived from the word “Bataquennac.”.</p>
            <h2>Creation</h2> 
            <p>In early 1687, the first site of Batac was San Jose, now called Palpalicong or Barangay No. 12. There were two separate communities at that time. One was the Christian Community which was headed by a chief called Captain Bazar, and the other one a Non-Christian group called Itneg, headed by a Captain Tagley who was then occupying Sitio Nangalisan, now a part of Barangay No. 25-S Payao.

                With the passing of time, the non-Christian were assimilated by the earnest and peaceloving Christians as Spain pushed through the frontiers by means of the cross and sword, the doctrines taught, and left it by Christ. From then on, the united communities grew into the town of Batac.
                
                Although Batac was founded by the famous conquistador Juan de Salcedo way back in 1577, shortly after he had established sovereignty in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, records available do not show what happened that year up to the year 1708. Let it suffice to state that like other communities, the people formed a government to the simplest type and rules were formulated to be followed by the people. It can be said that it passed thru the encomienda system which succeeded the barangay state of local government.</p>
